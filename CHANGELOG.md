## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Added the ability to set proxies for the client to use. See the docs for
more info.

### Changed
- Replaced thiserror with snafu for error implementions. There are some changes
to the error enum variants, check the docs if you depend on a specific variant.
- Depreciated RegisteredClient::get_interaction_url() in favor of
RegisteredClient::get_interaction_fqdn(). This is purely for naming accuracy, it returns the
same string as RegisteredClient::get_interaction_url() did.

No library changes, just bumping from release candidate to a full release.

    - `reqwest-native-tls` changed to `native-tls`
